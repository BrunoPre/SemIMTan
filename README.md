# Sem'IMT'an

A personal mobile application project in a React Native (Typescript) code base, wrapped by Expo

This application is intended:
- to be an alternative to the official Nantes public urban transport (TAN) one;
- to deliver a better user experience (2.1/2.6 stars on App/Play Store, see here: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tan/id502653639 and https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.semitan.tan); 
- to aim at learning cross-platform mobile development.

## Install
1. Make sure to have an Expo account and install Expo Go on your Android/iOS device
2. Clone this repo then `npm i` straight after.
3. To run the server & the app: `npx expo start`
4. Flash the generated QR code from your camera app on your phone (your system should redirect to Expo Go)
Otherwise, press `w` to run a local instance on your PC's web browser (not the best experience)

## Current features

- Navigation drawer using React Navigation
- List of lines/routes: number, directions and color
