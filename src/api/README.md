## Routes (number + name)

**TODO:** write a bash script to fetch the CSV file from NM OpenData -> convert it to JSON

Routes are stored as CSV in `./assets/csv/routes.csv`.

To convert CSV to JSON, go here: https://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-json.htm

Finally, store the JSON version at `./assets/json/`
